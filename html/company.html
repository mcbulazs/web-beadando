                <p>FromSoftware is a renowned video game developer based in Japan, known for its challenging and
                    immersive action RPGs. Founded in 1986, the company began by developing games for the original
                    PlayStation and has since become a household name among gamers. FromSoftware has a reputation for
                    creating games that are not only difficult but also deeply rewarding to players who persevere.

                <p id="valami">
                    One of the hallmarks of FromSoftware's games is their intricate level design. The company's games
                    often feature sprawling environments filled with hidden paths and secrets, encouraging players to
                    explore and discover new areas. FromSoftware's level design also tends to be highly interconnected,
                    with shortcuts and secret passages that allow players to navigate the world more efficiently.

                <p>
                    Another defining feature of FromSoftware's games is their challenging difficulty. Players must
                    carefully manage their resources and learn from their mistakes in order to progress through the
                    game. The combat system is typically based on stamina management, with players having to carefully
                    time their attacks and dodges to avoid taking damage. The difficulty of FromSoftware's games has
                    made them a favorite among hardcore gamers, who relish the challenge and the sense of accomplishment
                    that comes with overcoming it.
                </p>
                <p>Despite their difficulty, FromSoftware's games are also known for their deep and intricate lore. The
                    company's games often feature complex storylines and a wealth of world-building details, giving
                    players a rich and immersive experience. FromSoftware's games are also notable for their minimalist
                    storytelling approach, with much of the story and world-building conveyed through environmental
                    storytelling and item descriptions.</p>

                <h2>Hidetaka Miyazaki</h2>

                </a>
                <p>Hidetaka Miyazaki is a Japanese video game designer and director known for creating challenging and
                    atmospheric games that prioritize gameplay mechanics over flashy graphics. Miyazaki is known for his
                    unique game design philosophy that emphasizes player skill, exploration, and environmental storytelling.
                    Miyazaki's games are characterized by their deliberate combat, interconnected level design, and deep
                    lore that is often left up to player interpretation. He is also known for his collaborations with other
                    creatives, including writers and artists, which have helped to enrich the worlds and characters he
                    creates.
                    Miyazaki's innovative approach to game design has earned him a loyal fanbase and critical acclaim, with
                    many considering him to be one of the most influential video game designers of his generation. He
                    continues to work on new projects and push the boundaries of game design, with his games inspiring a new
                    generation of game developers and players alike
                </p>
                <p>Miyazaki's influence extends beyond his own games and has had a significant impact on the gaming industry as a whole. His design philosophy has inspired a wave of imitators and spawned a new sub-genre of action RPGs known as "Souls-like" games. Miyazaki's games have also influenced the way that developers approach game difficulty and storytelling, with many games now taking a more minimalist approach to both. In addition, Miyazaki's focus on player agency and exploration has helped to popularize the idea of emergent gameplay, where players are encouraged to experiment and discover new ways to play. As Miyazaki continues to innovate and create, his legacy in the gaming industry is sure to be felt for years to come.</p>
